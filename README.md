# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This Github Repo contains the following file:
* run_analysis.R: R code that (when run) allows answering the assignment questions. The final output is a file called "tidyData"
* CodeBook.md: Codebook for the r code with descriptions of the variables, etc.

To answer the questions of the assignment simply run the R code. The code is annotated and variables are detailed further in the Codebook.
