## CodeBook for "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project"

This code book modifies and updates the available codebooks (available with the source data) to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

The source data and including source codebooks are available in the .zip file downloaded by the r code.

### Overview of variables generated by the "run_analysis.R" code

The generated variables are listed by oorder of appearance in the r code

Input Data
* data.zip: source data and codebooks
* FeaturesTrain: data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
* ActivityTrain: data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt
* FeaturesTest: data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/x_test.txt
* ActivityTest: data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt
* SubjectTrain: data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt
* SubjectTest: data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt
* NamesFeatures: data/UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt
* LabelsActivity: data/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt

Generated data
* Features: "FeaturesTrain" & "FeaturesTest" combined
* Activity: "ActivityTrain" & "ActivityTest" combined
* Subject: "SubjectTrain" & "SubjectTest" combined
* fulldata: "Features" & "Activity" & "Subject" combined. -> One data set containing training and test data

* subsetdata: Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement of "fulldata"

* tidyData: The average of each variable for each activity and each subject of "subsetdata"

The labels of the included variables, units of measurement, and other information regarding the source data can be found in the codebooks of the input data.
